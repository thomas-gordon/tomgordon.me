I think a lot of us coders come from a background of tinkering with things outside the computing world. When I was a
teenager I took it upon myself to take apart old radios and broken things just to see the insides. The time I spent in this world
was clear, uncluttered by all the nonsense that accompanies adolescence. I think it was this tinkering bubble that lead me
to want to understand the web and the technology behind it. It also interested me more than conventional engineering because
it was still being developed; I had the real chance to contribute to the creation of web engineering itself.

This initial attraction is still the thing that keeps me going today. The problem is that so much of the way we are
deigned to work on involves giving up this sense of exploration and play because there is no time allocated to us for it.
The logic goes that we should learn how to do things while it is being expected we do them at a professional standard and
in a timely fashion. This is not conducive to good work and means stressed devs. How would the client react if they knew
that sometimes developers are given a job and then expected to finish it with little to no idea of the technology required
or how long it will take to implement?

This is why I think it's really important that devs get time to play. One way of doing this would be to Assign a task and 
then offer them time to complete the same job using two or more different approaches (eg. JS frameworks). Ask them why which
 one is better and break down their opinions. It is this interaction that will lead to higher memory retention 
 and a more applied developer.
