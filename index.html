<h2>The things I'm excited about <strong><small>Updated 09/03/15</small></strong></h2>

<h3>Tech</h3>

<p>I just bought myself a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises">pebble steel time watch</a> offa kickstarter.
	I convinced myself it would be a good idea because I love watches and smart things and this seems much more developed than the last one. 10 days battery? Ok!</p>

<h3>Music <a href="http://last.fm/user/flancexander"><small>my scrobbles</small></a></h3>

<p>I love it. I especially love <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand._Cannot._Erase.">this album</a>, just released by Steven Wilson. My ears go everywhere but naturally rest on rhythm focused, driving music. Prog attack!</p>

<h3>Recipe</h3>

<p>I love what slow cookers can do to basic cheap ingredients. The process of cooking is much more fluid and responsive than most sites on the web so I get a big kick out of it.</p>

<p>Here's one I made just the other day. It fed 4 extremely hungry boys. My satisfaction is based around how stonkered people are after the fact.</p>
