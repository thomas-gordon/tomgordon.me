# Hi, I'm Tom.

The internet is a complex blend of cultures, technologies, and marketing. My goal is to try and humanise this ecosystem.

Web development is often called ‘full stack development’. Though I have the skillset to work across the stack, I label myself as a subset of this: a frontend developer.
I focus on designing and creating user experiences that blend human cognition with technology.

As a team lead, I’ve learned to balance technical guidance, people management, and staying up-to-date with tools and technologies.

I consistently deliver digital projects that are compatible with various platforms. With 16 years of development experience, I can adapt project delivery to meet time, cost, and quality goals.

I started with simple HTML template manipulation when the internet became popular in the early 1990s. Now, I can deploy complete responsive React applications independently, from design to deployment.

I’m also familiar with Agile development methodologies, having worked on projects using both traditional waterfall approaches and Agile SCRUM frameworks.

## Currently at work I'm using the following tools to get the job done.

- **Tech Libraries:** [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), [Tanstack Suite](https://tanstack.com/)
- **Build tools:** [NPM Scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
- **Testing:** [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/)

- **Code Editing:** [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Deployment:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
