I think it's really, really important that coders get time to play. I think a lot of us come from a background of tinkering.
When I was a kid I took it upon myself to take apart old radios and broken things just to see the insides. I wasn't
so interested in marvelling at the complete piece, rather I wanted to learn why these things exist and why they (over other
things) were chosen to complete the whole. This attitude is similar now.

I can appreciate a fully fucntioning website as a whole.
It is after all, the end product of most of my labour. However, this moment is never the most important moment in a project for me.
For me it's finding a quicker or smoother way to achieve some part of the project. Completing an angular module that just works the first time.
Learning about compass' ability to create a sprite map. Having the client review it and only point out mistakes in the content
that they themselves wrote and provided.
