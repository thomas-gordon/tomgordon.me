I think it's really, really important that coders get time to play. Most of us come from a background of tinkering.
When I was a kid I took it upon myself to take apart old radios and broken things just to see the insides. I wasn't
so interested in how it all came together, the screws, the connections, nor did I care about the  rather I marvelled at
the fact that there existed in the world all these

different parts that could come together to form the whole.
