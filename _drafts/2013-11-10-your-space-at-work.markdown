If you see a tradie wearing overalls on the job, odds are they're branded Hard Yakka. This isn't just because the brand
is fashionable, it's because it represents something tradies want; lasting quality. If you talk to an athelete they will
be able to go into great detail about the swim wear they use every day in the pool. If you watch a top-tier chef at work
they are not carrying around a knife that they picked up at Coles. It'll be some carefully balanced, razor sharp masterpiece of
some kind of fancy mixed alloy barely anyone knows how to fashion.

If you go into a digital agency with dedicated desktop computers odds are everyone but the coders are sitting there for
eight hours a day, just typing away on their microsoft $4 computer with a set of Apple headphones plugged into their box
for work 'tunes. What ever happened to the 'best tools for the job'? Why is it that a person who does work all day on a computer doesn't
need a nice keyboard, nice headphones, nice tools! Seems whack to me.
