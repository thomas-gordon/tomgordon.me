I just set my new site up with jekyll! It's been a while coming, my old site was in vast need of a more dynamic option
but at the same time I didn't want to add too much load to it. This was I can have my blog and eat it too!

I'm planning to brain dump anything that I deem pressing in terms of Web Dev here. I've recently been working with Laravel 4
 a whole lot with my work at Arkade in Melbourne and I've seen that project evolve to something extremely powerful and dev-friendly.
 Aside from that I'll be talking about any sass/scss stuff that I think is worth sharing in this tiny corner of the web.
 For you now you can check out my [work here](/work.html).
