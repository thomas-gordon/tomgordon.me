title:  "Switching Gears"
categories: musings the-job

In the last year I've had three different full-time jobs. While that might sound unstable, I can assure you it's the result of one simple thing; that I've started to put myself first. 

How I allocate my time has become powerfully important to me. The lustre of the 'early-relationship' stage of my front-end career has calmed, allowing me to realise that if you're working on the web and have the capacity to do so, you should be working on projects that have a broader reach than the corporate space. By corporate space I mean working on projects that have some (or all) of the following results:

* Trick the user instead of leading them.
* Hide important information when it might be misconstrued as giving a negative light to the brand.


Give something back that isn't just another meaningless template. _Why_ are you cutting up a basic web app that is specifically designed to trick people into buying something? 

Once you can see clearly with the technology, it's important to give meaning to that clarity. 

Don't get me wrong, I have thoroughly enjoyed working in very different places but the work can get very grey.
